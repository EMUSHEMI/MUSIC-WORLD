        Happier Than Ever
      </h1>
      <p class="lyrics billie-song-lyrics">
        When I'm away from you, I'm happier than ever <br>
        Wish I could explain it better <br>
        I wish it wasn't true <br>
        Give me a day or two to think of something clever <br>
        To write myself a letter <br>
        To tell me what to do, mm-mmm <br>
        Do you read my interviews? <br>
        Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue) <br>
        When you (when you) said you were passing through <br>
        Was I even on your way? <br>
        I knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to) <br>
        Be cool about what I was telling you <br>
        You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do) <br>
        And I'd end up more afraid <br>
        Don't say it isn't fair <br>
        You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable <br>
        So if you really wanna know <br>
        When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you) <br>
        I'm happier than ever (happier than ever) <br>
        Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better) <br>
        I wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mmm-mmm <br>
        You call me again, drunk in your Benz <br>
        Driving home under the influence <br>
        You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath <br>
        'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends <br>
        I don't relate to you <br>
        I don't relate to you, no <br>
        'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty <br>
        You made me hate this city <br>
        And I don't talk shit about you on the internet <br>
        Never told anyone anything bad <br>
        'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything <br>
        And all that you did was make me fucking sad <br>
        So don't waste the time I don't have <br>
        And don't try to make me feel bad <br>
        I could talk about every time that you showed up on time <br>
        But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did <br> <br>
        Never paid any mind to my mother or friends <br>
        So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid <br>
        You ruined everything good <br>
        Always said you were misunderstood <br>
        Made all my moments your own <br>
        Just fucking leave me alone <br>
