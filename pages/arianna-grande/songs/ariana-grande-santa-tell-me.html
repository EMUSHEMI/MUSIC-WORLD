       Santa Tell Me
      </h1>
      <p class="lyrics ariana-grande-song-lyrics">
 [Chorus] <br>
Santa, tell me if you're really there <br>
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <br>
Santa, tell me if he really cares <br>
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <br>

[Verse 1] <br>
Feeling Christmas all around <br>
And I'm trying to play it cool <br>
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room <br>
"Let It Snow" is blasting out <br>
But I won't get in the mood <br>
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's <br>

[Pre-Chorus] <br>
True love that he thinks of <br>
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy <br>

[Chorus] <br>
Santa, tell me if you're really there <br>
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <br>
Santa, tell me if he really cares <br>
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <br>

[Verse 2] <br>
I've been down this road before <br>
Fell in love on Christmas night <br>
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side <br>
Now I need someone to hold <br>
Be my fire in the cold <br>
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's <br>
You might also like <br>
All I Want for Christmas Is You <br>

[Pre-Chorus] <br>
True love that he thinks of <br>
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy <br>

[Chorus] <br>
Santa, tell me if you're really there <br>
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <br>
Santa, tell me if he really cares <br>
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <br>

[Bridge] <br>
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh <br>
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh <br>
But I don't want a new broken heart <br>
This year I've got to be smart <br>
Oh, baby <br>
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me) <br>
If he will be, if he will be here <br>
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me) <br>
Oh, woah <br>

[Chorus] <br>
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care) <br>
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <br>
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy) <br>
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <br>
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby) <br>
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here) <br>
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?) <br>
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <br>
