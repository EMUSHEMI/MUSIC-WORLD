        [Intro: JAY-Z & Beyoncé] <br>
        So crazy right now <br>
        Most incredibly <br>
        It's your girl, B <br>
        It's your boy, Young <br>
        You ready? <br>
        
        [Refrain: Beyoncé & JAY-Z] <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no (Oww!) <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no <br>
        
        [Interlude: JAY-Z] <br>
        Ch-yeah! <br>
        History in the making, part two! <br>
        It's so crazy right now <br>
        
        [Verse 1: Beyoncé] <br>
        I look and stare so deep in your eyes  <br>
        I touch on you more and more every time <br>
        When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go <br>
        Call your name two, three times in a row <br>
        Such a funny thing for me to try to explain <br>
        How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah) <br>
        'Cause I know I don't understand <br>
        Just how your love can do what no one else can <br>
    
        [Chorus: Beyoncé] <br>
        Got me looking so crazy right now <br>
        Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love) <br>
        Got me looking so crazy right now <br>
        Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch) <br>
        Got me hoping you'll page me right now <br>
        Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now <br>
        Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking <br>
        Got me looking so crazy in love <br>
        
        [Refrain: Beyoncé] <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no <br>
        Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no <br>
        
        [Verse 2: Beyoncé] <br>
        When I talk to my friends so quietly <br>
        ("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me <br>
        Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress  <br>
        If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress <br>
        It's the way that you know what I thought I knew <br>
        It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you <br>
        But I still don't understand <br>
        Just how your love can do what no one else can <br>
        
        
        [Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z] <br>
        Got me looking so crazy right now <br>
        Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love) <br>
        Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love) <br>
        Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch) <br>
        Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah) <br>
        Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey) <br>
        Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Ch-yeah!) <br>
        Got me looking so crazy in love (Ch-yeah!) <br>
        I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Whoo!) <br>
        Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go) <br>
        
        [Verse 3: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
        Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco (No) <br>
        Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh, no) <br>
        O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (No, no) <br>
        Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (No, no, no) <br>
        Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel <br>
        I shake phonies man you can't get next to <br>
        The genuine article, I do not sing though <br>
        I sling though, if anything, I bling yo <br>
        A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret <br>
        You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh) <br>
        JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged <br>
        They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insan>e?" <br>
        Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth <br>
        My texture is the best fur, chinchilla <br>
        I've been iller than chain smokers (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no) <br>
        How you think I got the name Hova? (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no) <br>
        I been realer, the game's over <br>
        Fall back, Young (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no) <br>
        Ever since I made the change over to platinum (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no) <br>
        The game's been a wrap, one <br>
        
        
        [Bridge: Beyoncé] <br>
        Got me looking, so crazy, my baby <br>
        I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this <br>
        I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care <br>
        'Cause your love's got the best of me <br>
        And baby, you're making a fool of me <br>
        You got me sprung and I don't care who sees <br>
        'Cause baby, you got me, you got me <br>
        You got me so crazy, baby (Hey!) <br>
        
        [Chorus: Beyoncé] <br>
        Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love) <br>
        Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Looking crazy) <br>
        Got me looking so crazy right now <br>
        Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Baby, your touch) <br>
        Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah, babe) <br>
        Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Oh) <br>
        Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Yeah) <br>
        Got me looking so crazy in love (Whoa)v
        Got me looking so crazy right now <br>
        Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love) <br>
        Got me looking so crazy right now <br>
        Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch) <br>
        Got me hoping you'll page me right now <br>
        Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now <br>
        Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking <br>
        Got me looking so crazy in love <br>
